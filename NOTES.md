Competitive programming can be challenging, and it's normal to encounter difficulties, especially when you're starting. Here are some tips that might help you improve in competitive programming:

1. **Start with the Basics:** Ensure you have a good grasp of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.). There are numerous online resources and books available to help you understand these concepts.

2. **Practice Regularly:** Solve problems regularly on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeChef. Consistent practice is key to improving your problem-solving skills.

3. **Analyze Solutions:** After solving a problem or attempting it, analyze the solutions provided by others. Understand different approaches and algorithms used. Learn from these solutions, and try to implement them on your own.

4. **Participate in Contests:** Join programming contests regularly. Even if you can't solve all the problems, participating will expose you to different types of problems and increase your familiarity with problem-solving techniques.

5. **Learn from Mistakes:** Don't get discouraged by failures. Instead, learn from your mistakes. Review your unsuccessful attempts and understand why certain approaches didn't work.

6. **Seek Guidance:** Join online forums or communities where you can ask questions, seek help, and discuss problems with fellow programmers. You might also consider finding a mentor or joining a study group to get support and guidance.

7. **Stay Persistent:** Improvement takes time and consistent effort. Don’t give up easily. Keep practicing and challenging yourself with new problems.

8. **Stay Updated:** Keep yourself updated with new algorithms, techniques, and trends in competitive programming. Follow blogs, attend webinars, or read books/articles related to advanced topics.

Remember, competitive programming requires dedication and patience. It's a skill that develops over time with persistent effort and practice. Don't be too hard on yourself if progress seems slow – focus on continuous learning and improvement.
